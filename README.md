# ANN-CNN-CIFAR10
cifar10 is the most common dataset used to learn and train the models. So in this project i created an ann and a cnn model. In the dataset we have 10 items that are airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship and truck.We have to predict the image is of which thing according to the data given.The accuracy of ann model is around 49% but when i used cnn it gives the accuracy of 70% . This is a tough dataset to understand so 70% accuracy is not bad. In cnn convolution layer and pooling layer is added to give the more accuracy.
